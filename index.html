    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a CS student doing BS/MS at UCSB, interested in Software Engineering, Systems, and Artificial Intelligence.
        I finished my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2025 and expect to finish my MS in Computer Science in June 2027.
        Currently, I am looking for an internship for Summer 2026 in tech.
        I have extensive work and research experience.
        Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinghan-yang/">LinkedIn</a>  if you are interested.
        Outside of work, I love the outdoors and spending time in nature, including backpacking, running, rock climbing, and skiing.
        You can learn more about my expertise and other interests at the bottom of this page.
        Also, I am looking for research opportunities as a first-year MS student, intended to do the thesis or project track.
        Please hit me up if you want to learn more about what I do.
