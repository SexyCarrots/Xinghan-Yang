<h1>Rock Climbing</h1>
<p>
  Rock climbing is one of my interest. I mostly climb at the UCSB Rec Cen and outdoors around Santa Barbara.
  I love sunset bouldering sessions, top-rope days with friends in the mountains, and learning more about belay technique and
  anchor building on different terrain. Rock climbing help me focus and deal with stress, whcih is common among CS students.
  Below is a short FAQ about my local climbing life.
